## Deployment 

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
  - Once the Main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 
  - I then had to wait a few minutes until the site was fully deployed and it was ready.
